# BruteforceD
This is a script that helps you to bruteforce login page of the following sites: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram.
I think you will find this script useful because I choose the sites that are most likely to get hacked. 
To start a attack you need the username and wordlist with guested passwords created by you or from a script. 
The script is written in python so you need to have python installed, script is tested on Kali Linux and should work properly on this system.


To get the script working you have to go to terminal and write:<br/>
git clone https://github.com/ulathiel/BruteforceD.git
cd Bruteforce
python bruteforceD.py -h
