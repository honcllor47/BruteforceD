# BruteforceD
This is a script that helps you to bruteforce login page of the following sites: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram. <br/>
I think you will find this script useful because I choose the sites that are most likely to get hacked. <br/>
To start a attack you need the username and wordlist with guested passwords created by you or from a script. <br/>
The script is written in python so you need to have python installed, script is tested on Kali Linux and should work properly on this system. <br/><br/>


To get the script working you have to go to terminal and write: <br/>
git clone https://github.com/ulathiel/BruteforceD.git <br/>
cd BruteforceD <br/>
cd brutforce <br/>
python brutforceD.py -h <br/>
